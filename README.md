## How to Play

Two players are required to play. Players will need to play on separate devices or separate browser windows. Each player starts the game by entering thier name. Player one begins the game by choosing a hand representing rock, paper or scissors. After player one chooses, it is player two's turn to choose.

* If one player chose rock and the other player chose scissors, rock wins.
* If one player chose scissors and the other player chose paper, scissors wins.
* If one player chose paper and the other player chose rock, paper wins.
* If both players select the same hand, it's a tie.

The winner gets one point in wins, the loser gets one point in losses. Players can decide to play for a determined number of turns or just play until they get tired of playing.

## Live Chat

Players will be able to chat while playing. Perfect for catching up when the game gets slow or trash talking to throw off an opponent on a winning streak. Chats are logged in the Firebase database and displayed in the chat window until the game is reset.
